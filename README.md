# How to implement weak measurement in IBM Qiskit?
In this tutorial, I will explain how to implement two types of weak measurement operators in IBM Qiskit.
 1. Complete weak measurement operators.
 2. Partial weak measurement operators.

These operators have been experimentally implemented in photonic architecture. Here, I will guide you on implementing them from home using IBM Qiskit.
